**Hi!** I'm Travis, and I ~~like warm hugs~~ build software for a living.

## Professional

:computer: Mostly backend software engineer, but I've done lots of full stack work

:coffee: Java and Go are my favorite languages and ones with which I have the most experience

:movie_camera: I currently work at Netflix on the Telemetry Engineering team, specifically the centralized logging team

:cloud: I previously worked at Google on both the video ads and cloud teams

:sailboat: I've previously worked on [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io), an OSS continuous delivery platform for cloud native applications

:books: I love learning - software engineering is great because there's always something new to learn and explore and grow
