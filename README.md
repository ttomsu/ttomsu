**Hi!** I'm Travis, and I ~~like warm hugs~~ build software for a living.

## Professional

:computer: Mostly backend software engineer, but I've done lots of full stack work

:coffee: Java and Go are my favorite languages and ones with which I have the most experience

:cloud: I currently work at Google on the Google Cloud Platform ([Spring Cloud GCP](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/spring-cloud-gcp) team)

:sailboat: I've previously worked on [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io), an OSS continuous delivery platform for cloud native applications

:books: I love learning - software engineering is great because there's always something new to learn and explore and grow

## Personal

:ski: I love skiing - particularly in Colorado when I can get there, but Vermont is much closer to home

:muscle: [I lift things up and put them down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7gzmoqmL7g)

:baby: I'm a father to two boys

:moneybag: I love talking and thinking about personal finance

:headphones: I enjoy audiobooks and podcasts (goes back to that love of learning things)

:pig: I like to grill and smoke meats
